    "- **AI prompts used + modifications made afterwards**:\n",
    "  - We asked **ChatGPT** to provide an **example of how to calculate ENMO** and integrate it over different epoch lengths.\n",
    "  - We then **adapted this example to our own assignment**: we changed the CSV filename, recreated the notebook cells one by one in VS Code, and adjusted the code so it works with our own dataset.\n"
